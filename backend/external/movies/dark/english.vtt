00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.800
(O, say can you see, By the dawn's early light.)

2
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.200
You are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father,

3
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.900
I swore to them that I would protect you, and I haven't

4
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900
(By the twilight's last gleaming.)

5
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.440
storm coming, Mr Wayne

6
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.440
you and your friends better batten down the hatches,

7
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
because, when it hits,

8
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.400
you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large

9
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.300
and leave so little for the rest of us.

10
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:15.500
(Prisoner's chanting in Arabic: Deshi, deshi, bashara, bashara)

11
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.400
What does that mean ?

12
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
Rise.

13
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.400
When Gotham is ashes,

14
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
you have my permission to die.

15
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:52.400
